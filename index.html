        The Super Mario video game series is a series of platform video games created by Nintendo <br>
        featuring their mascot, Mario. Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series or simply the Mario <br>
        series, it is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been <br>
        released for every major Nintendo video game console and handheld.<br><br>
    
        The Super Mario games follow Mario's adventures in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, usually <br>
        with Mario as the player character. He is occasionally joined by his brother, Luigi, and other <br>
        members of the Mario cast. As in platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms <br>
        and atop enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario rescuing the <br>
        kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first title in the series, the 1985 <br>
        Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) release of Super Mario Bros., established gameplay <br>
        concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every Super Mario game since, including a multitude of <br>
        power-ups and items that give Mario special powers like fireball-throwing and size-changing into <br>
        giant and miniature sizes. <br><br>
        The Super Mario series is part of the greater Mario franchise, which includes other video game <br>
        genres as well as media such as film, television, printed media and merchandise. Over 262 million <br>
        copies of games in the Super Mario series have been sold worldwide, making it the best-selling <br>
        video game franchise. <br>

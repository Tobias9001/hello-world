        Shigeru Miyamoto created Mario while developing Donkey Kong in an attempt to produce a <br>
        best-selling video game for Nintendo; previous titles like Sheriff had not achieved the same success <br>
        as titles like Pac-Man. Originally, Miyamoto wanted to create a video game that used the characters <br>
        Popeye, Bluto, and Olive Oyl.[4] At the time, however, Miyamoto was unable to acquire a <br>
        to use the characters (and would not until 1982), so he ended up making Jumpman (later known as <br>
        Mario), Donkey Kong, and Pauline. In the early stages of Donkey Kong, Mario was unable to jump, <br>
        and the focus was to escape a maze. However, Miyamoto enabled Mario to jump, saying "If you <br>
        had a barrel rolling towards you, what would you do?"<br><br>
        Miyamoto originally named the character "Mr. Video", and he was to be used in every video game <br>
        Miyamoto developed. According to a widely circulated story, during localization of Donkey Kong <br>
        for North American audiences, Nintendo of America's warehouse landlord Mario Segale confronted <br>
        its then-president Minoru Arakawa, demanding back rent. Following a heated argument in which <br>
        the Nintendo employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid, they opted to name the <br>
        character in the game Mario after him <br>
        Miyamoto commented that if he had named Mario "Mr. Video", Mario likely would have <br>
        "disappeared off the face of the Earth." By Miyamoto's own account, Mario's profession was chosen <br>
        to fit with the game design. Since Donkey Kong was set on a construction site, Mario was made <br>
        into a carpenter. When he appeared again in Mario Bros., it was decided he should be a plumber, <br>
        since a lot of the game is played in underground settings <br><br><br>

        Toad
    </h1>
    <p>
        Toad and the mushroom people were first seen in the game Super Mario Bros. where the species <br>
        was revealed to comprise the majority of the population of the Mushroom Kingdom. Toad's design <br>
        was made directly from the power up the Super Mushroom, as well as the game's general <br>
        association with mushrooms.Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of the Mario franchise, reasons that <br>
        Toad's creation was that of being a character that has a simplistic design; yet, still appears cute and <br>
        lovely and pleasing to everybody. In the game, the peaceful Toads of the Mushroom Kingdom had <br>
        been turned into various objects such as bricks and pipes by the evil King Bowser; however, some <br>
        of Princess Toadstool's loyal servants, known as the "Mushroom Retainers," were simply <br>
        kidnapped.<br><br>
        During the development of New Super Mario Bros. Wii, the developers at Nintendo decided <br>
        between four characters to be playable in the game: Princess Peach, Toad, Wario and Waluigi (all <br>
        suggestions made by fans).Two Toads (Yellow and Blue) were eventually included as playable <br>
        characters in New Super Mario Bros. Wii due to their physical similarity to Mario and Luigi.<br>
        Toad's English name appears to have been inspired by the word "toadstool", a word used to describe <br>
        mushrooms including those featuring umbrella-like cap-and-stem form characteristics which Toad's <br>
        design portrays along with the character's general resemblance to a mushroom. Toad's Japanese <br>
        name "Kinopio" appears to be a mixture of the Japanese word for mushroom ("kinoko") and the <br>
        Japanese name for the character Pinocchio ("Pinokio") which both roughly blend together to form <br>
        the meaning of "a real mushroom boy" (as evidenced through Pinocchio's desire to become a real <br>
        boy in his own tale)<br>

    <h1>
        Yoshi
    </h1>
    <p>
        Yoshi has a variety of abilities that make him stand out amongst other characters in the Mario series. <br>
        He has a prehensile tongue that can extend a surprising distance, allowing him to eat almost <br>
        anything; anything that can't be eaten can be spit out at enemies. In some games the tongue can also <br>
        be used as a grappling hook to pull objects or access otherwise out-of-reach areas. Yoshi is also <br>
        capable of laying distinctive spotted eggs after swallowing objects, which can then be thrown at <br>
        enemies or objects; eggs are in fact the primary "logo" of Yoshi in multiplayer games. Yoshi is also <br>
        capable of forming an egg around himself and rolling around. By rapidly flapping his arms and legs, <br>
        Yoshi can hover in midair or even gain height (depending on the game), this "flutter jump" makes <br>  
        difficult jumps much easier to accomplish. Yoshi is also a heavy user of the ground pound, dropping <br>
        from the air onto targets. Yoshi's large nose allows him to detect hidden collectibles by smell, and <br>
        aside from kicks and tail whips, is Yoshi's main instrument of close-range combat.<br><br>
        Yoshis come in a variety of colours, including green, red, blue, yellow, cyan, pink, purple, black, <br>
        white, orange, and brown. In some games the colour of a Yoshi provides additional abilities: in <br>
        Super Mario World, red Yoshis can breathe fire, blue Yoshis have wings, and yellow Yoshis produce <br>
        damaging dust clouds on landing. In other games, eating fruit changes a Yoshi's colour and provides <br>
        an ability; Yoshis in Super Mario Sunshine can spit fruit juice to defeat enemies and create <br>
        platforms, while those in Super Mario Galaxy 2 can use fruit to gain super speed, inflate like a <br>
        balloon, or produce a platform-enabling glow. Yoshis of various colours appear often in multiplayer <br>
        games as alternate choices, which may or may not have tweaked stats.<br>
